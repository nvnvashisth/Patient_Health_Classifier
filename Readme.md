#Data Challenge

1. Keep the data (features.csv and labels.csv) and Patient.ipynb file in same folder.

2. Make sure you have all dependencies resolved in python for below libraries

'''
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
'''

3. Then open Patient.ipynb file which is self explanatory.
